				<p class="main-contant">Many scientists opposed him.
"nonsense!"
said a famous American scientist.
Most geologists made fun of the concept that would completely change the earth sciences.
They considered him an outsider doubting basic ideas of geology.
Wegener also thought that the continents floated like ice in water.
But most geologists strongly believed that the continents and oceans held fixed positions.
They doubted Wegener because no one knew of any mechanism which could separate the continents.
Wegener did not back down.
He devoted the rest of his life to looking for more evidence.
But his theory was never accepted in his lifetime.
In 1930 , he died during an expedition to Greenland.
If Wegener had lived until now , he would have seen his theory become widely accepted.
New evidence from earth science has awakened interest in Wegener's theory.
Many of his ideas clearly served as the basis of the theory of plate tectonics.

Plate tectonics is a relatively new theory , introduced about 40 years ago.
It helps to explain the movement of the continents.
Wegener was right in most of his major concepts, the continents have slowly been moving around the earth's surface.
The speeds at which plates travel at speeds of between 1 and 10cm per year.
This is about the same as the rate at which your fingernails grow.
All the continents on the earth are now moving toward Asia.
At some future date , perhaps between 200 and 300 million years from now , a new supercontinent might be formed Then you could drive around the world!</p>

				<p>Today, Im going to talk about Japan, especially about Japanese food culture. Recently, I often hear the news that Japanese government will file a formal nomination of "Washoku"(和食）: Traditional Dietary Cultures of the Japanese'' to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in March. A decision by UNESCO is not expected before November 2013 at the earliest. 　Internationally, washoku has a high reputation. What is used for the base of taste in washoku is "dashi," Japanese style broth.
Dashi is really important for washoku to bring out the rich and delicate flavors of foods. In my town, the industry of katsuobushi is very popular. Katsuobushi is one of the main items to make "dashi" soup from. My town is small but there are almost 30 katsuobusi factories in my town.　I'd like to make full-blown miso soup by making broth with Katsuobushi from my town for my host family in America. It's not kind of Washoku, but we japanese have familiarity with Obento. now, I'm going to talk about latest Japanese food culture related obento. Japan is also known for Japanese pop culture like Anime. If we, Japanese hear "Anime" , we tend to get reminded of "Otaku. " but, Doraemon, which everyone knows, is also one of Anime. What is more, how many Japanese grow up with watching anpanman? Including famous characters expressing each prefectures in Japan, we can understand that Anime and character culture deeply take root in Japan. There are countless characters in Japan. Sometimes, those characters are loved by not only kids but also women. 
Obento which is decorated to be looked like some characters is called "charaben." For example, pikachu that is an important character from famous Pokemon and Hello Kitty that is loved by women worldwide are used. Charaben of pikachu, the yellow body of pikachu is made of boilled egg. And his black eyes are made of seaweed. Rice with Sakura denpun(starch) for kitty's pink ribbon. And her black eyes and eyelashes are also made of seaweed or seed. Charaben looks very pretty. The prettiness of charaben can make kids try to eat foods they don't like. The Japanese dexterity is reflected in charaben. Charaben attract many people's attentions worldwide and we can get recipes of charaben in English on the internet. Japanese, who come up with a fresh idea like charaben, are so interesting. I hope Japanese food culture including washoku and charaben make people around the world more interested in Japan.</p>
